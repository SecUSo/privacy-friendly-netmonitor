        This app scans active network connections in background. The detected connections are
        listed with their invoking apps, the remote host (if resolvable) and an identification of
        the service used. \n \n
        Additionally, very detailed technical information can be displayed by touching one of the
        listed connections. An automatic Certificate Validation and SSL Server Test can be toggled in
        the setting, allowing Net Monitor to request a Transport Layer Security (TLS) rating of addressed Servers.
        The ratings are provided by SSL-Labs (<a href="https:www.ssllabs.com"/>), see "help" for further information.
        \n \n
        This App has been developed with privacy in mind, and does not use any unnecessary
        permissions and does not save or transmit any personal data.
        For further information see "help" or pick "about" in the navigation.

    <string name="help_whatis">What is Privacy Friendly Net Monitor?</string>
    <string name="help_whatis_answer">Privacy Friendly Net Monitor monitors
        network traffic produced by installed apps on the device. It scans active network connections with a background
        service and displays them with additional network encryption information.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_one">Connection Monitoring</string>
    <string name="help_feature_one_answer">Net Monitor deploys an background service which scans for
        active connections every second. The apps invoking a detected connections are identified and
        listed with icon and remote addresses they are communicating with. The connection overview
        can be refreshed by swiping down on the display or touching the refresh button in the toolbar.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_two">Protocol/Encryption Detection</string>
    <string name="help_feature_two_answer">Based on a connection\'s remote port, the transport protocol
        can be identified by "Well Known Port" tables. Based on the known ports, a warning is given
        if a connection is known for not beeing encrypted. Note that this is no grantee
        that the connection uses this protocol, since assignment of port numbers is not enforced by the system.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_three">Hostname Resolution</string>
    <string name="help_feature_three_answer">The remote host name assigned is requested by
        reverse name resolution. This is done asynchronously in background and may take some seconds.
        The resolved hostname may not be the actual domain name requested by e.g. a browser app.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_four">Detailed Reports</string>
    <string name="help_feature_four_answer">A detailed mode can be toggled in the settings.
        When activated, additional technical information of scanned connections is displayed when a
        connection is touched in the overview.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_five">Certificate Validation</string>
    <string name="help_feature_five_answer">An automatic analysis of the remote servers TLS
        implementation can be activated in the settings. When active, remote servers with a resolved
        hostname are tested automatically when the connection protocol is known for having TLS
        encryption. The analysis is performed by SSL Lab API and the associated service. The remote
        server\'s implementation quality is shown in grades A+ (best) to F (worst), or is displayed
        as T (trust issues). For further information on SSL Lab API see the about.</string>
    <string name="help_privacy">What makes the app privacy-friendly?</string>
    <string name="help_privacy_answer">Privacy Friendly App Example does not require any system
        permission to scan network connections. It does not include any tracking mechanisms
        or advertisement and comes free of charge. Privacy Friendly Net Monitor is published under
        GPLv3 license and is free to distribute or extend.</string>
    <string name="help_permission">Which permissions requires the app?</string>
    <string name="help_permission_answer">Privacy Friendly App Example does not require any permission
        for scanning active connections. The Certificate Validation feature requires
        android.permissions.INTERNET to request server test results from Qualys SSL Labs.</string>
