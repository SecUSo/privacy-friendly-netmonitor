    <string name="help_whatis">What is Privacy Friendly Net Monitor?</string>
    <string name="help_whatis_answer">Privacy Friendly Net Monitor monitors
        network traffic from installed apps. It scans active network connections with a background
        service and also displays additional network encryption information.</string>

    <string name="help_feature_one">How does connection monitoring work?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_one_answer">Net Monitor deploys an background service, which scans for
        active connections every second. Apps invoking the detected connections are identified and
        listed with remote addresses they are communicating with.</string>

    <string name="help_feature_two">What is protocol and encryption detection?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_two_answer">Based on a connection\'s remote port, the transport protocol
        can be identified by "Well Known Port" tables. Based on the known ports, a warning is given
        in case a connection is known for not being encrypted. Note, that this is no grantee
        that the connection uses this protocol, since assignment of port numbers is not enforced by the system.</string>

    <string name="help_feature_three">What is hostname resolution?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_three_answer">The remote host name assigned is requested by
        reverse name resolution. This is done asynchronously in background and may take some seconds.
        The resolved hostname may not be the actual domain name requested by e.g. a browser app.</string>

    <string name="help_feature_four">What are detailed reports?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_four_answer">A detailed mode can be switched on in the settings.
        After activation additional technical information of scanned connections is displayed after a
        connection has been touched in the overview.</string>

    <string name="help_feature_five">What is certificate validation?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_five_answer">An automatic analysis of the remote servers TLS
        implementation can be activated in the settings. When active, remote servers with a resolved
        hostname are tested automatically when the connection protocol is known for using TLS
        encryption. The analysis is performed by SSL Labs API and the associated service. The remote
        server\'s implementation quality is shown in grades A+ (best) to F (worst), or is displayed
        as T (trust issues). For further information on SSL Lab API see the about.</string>

    <string name="help_privacy">What makes the app privacy-friendly?</string>

    <string name="help_privacy_answer">Privacy Friendly Net Monitor does not include any tracking mechanisms
        or advertisement and comes free of charge. Privacy Friendly Net Monitor is published under
        GPLv3 license and is free to distribute or extend.</string>

    <string name="help_permission">Which permissions requires the app?</string>
    <string name="help_permission_answer">Privacy Friendly Net Monitor does not require any permission
        for scanning active connections. The Certificate Validation feature requires
        the Internet permission to request server test results from Qualys SSL Labs.</string>
