    <string name="loremIpsum">Welcome to Privacy Friendly TLS Metric. \n \n
        This app scans active network connections in background. The detected connections are
        listed with their invoking apps, the remote host (if resolvable) and an identification of
        the service used. \n \n
        Additionally, very detailed technical information can be displayed by touching one of the
        listed connections. An automatic Certificate Validation and SSL Server Test can be toggled in
        the setting, allowing TLS Metric to request a Transport Layer Security (TLS) rating of addressed Servers.
        The ratings are provided by SSL-Labs (<a href="https:www.ssllabs.com"/>), see "help" for further information.
        \n \n
        This App has been developed with privacy in mind, and does not use any unnecessary
        permissions and does not save or transmit any personal data.
        For further information see "help" or pick "about" in the navigation.

    <string name="help_whatis">What is Privacy Friendly TLS Metric?</string>
    <string name="help_whatis_answer">Privacy Friendly TLS Metric is an application for monitoring
        network traffic from installed apps. It scans active network connections with a background
        service and displays it with additional information concerning network encryption
        (Transport Layer Security, TLS).</string>
    <string name="help_feature_one">Connection Monitoring</string>
    <string name="help_feature_one_answer">TLS Metric deploys an background service, scanning for
        active connections once every second. The apps, invoking the connections are identified and
        are listed with their icon and the amount of remote addresses they are communicating with in
        a connection overview. The connection overview can be refreshed by swiping down on the display.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_two">Protocol/Encryption Detection</string>
    <string name="help_feature_two_answer">Based on a connections remote port, the transport protocol
        can be identified by "Well Known Port" tables. Based on this information, a warning is given
        if a connection is known for not having an encryption employed. Note that this is no grantee
        that the connection uses this protocol, since the assignment port numbers is not enforced.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_three">Hostname Resolution</string>
    <string name="help_feature_three_answer">The hostname assigned to remote address is requested by
        name resolution. This is done asynchronously in background and may take some seconds.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_four">Detailed Reports</string>
    <string name="help_feature_four_answer">A detailed mode can be toggled in the settings view.
        When activated, a scanned connection can be touched to display additional, technical
        information on the given connection.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_five">Certificate Validation</string>
    <string name="help_feature_five_answer">An automatic test of the remote servers encryption
        implementation can be activated in the settings view. When active, remote servers with a resolved hostname are tested automatically,
        when the connection protocol is known for employing TLS encryption. The server testing is
        performed by SSL Lab\'s SSL Server Test (<a href="https:www.ssllabs.com"/>). The remote server\'s encryption
        quality is shown in grades A+ (best) to F (worst). For further information on SSL Lab API
        see the about view.</string>
    <string name="help_privacy">What makes the app privacy-friendly?</string>
    <string name="help_privacy_answer">Privacy Friendly App Example does not require any root
        permission to scan active connections. It further does not include any tracking mechanisms
        or advertisement and comes free of charge. Privacy Friendly TLS Metric is published under
        GPLv3 license and therefore is free to distribute or extend.</string>
    <string name="help_permission">Which permissions requires the app?</string>
    <string name="help_permission_answer">Privacy Friendly App Example does not require any permission
        for scanning active connections. The Certificate Validation / SSL Server Test feature requires
        INTERNET permissions to request server test results from Qualys SSL Labs (<a href="https:www.ssllabs.com"/>).</string>
