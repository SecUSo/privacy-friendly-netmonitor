Privacy Friendly Net Monitor is an Android application that can identify and monitor active network connections of applications that are installed on the mobile device. 
It monitors active network sockets and provides information about the scanned connections and apps. The invoking app is identified and listed with it's name, package and icon. The Connection's local and remote socket information (ip/port) is displayed along with a resolved hostname information and protocol evaluation based on well-known ports. Known un-/encrypted protocols are automatically marked. Privacy Friendly Net Monitor does not require a rooted device.

Privacy Friendly Net Monitor is optimized regarding the user’s privacy. It doesn’t use any tracking mechanisms, neither it displays any advertisement. It belongs to the Privacy Friendly Apps group developed by the SECUSO research group at Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany.
